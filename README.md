# 🔬 Carbon Atom Visualization  

This project is a **3D interactive visualization** of the Carbon atom, showing its **nucleus (protons & neutrons)** and **electron shells (inner & outer orbitals)**. It is designed to provide an easy-to-understand representation of atomic structure for students, educators, and enthusiasts.

## ⚛️ Features  
- **3D Atom Model** – Interactive visualization of protons, neutrons, and electrons.  
- **Electron Shells** – Shows 2 electrons in the inner shell and 4 electrons in the outer shell.  
- **Nucleus Details** – Displays 6 protons (positive charge) and 6 neutrons (no charge).  
- **Educational Labels** – Clear labels for atomic structure.  
- **Dark Themed Design** – Space-like background for a realistic atomic feel.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **JavaScript / Three.js** (or WebGL) for 3D rendering  
- **HTML5 / CSS3** for structure and styling  
- **Optional:** React.js for component-based design
